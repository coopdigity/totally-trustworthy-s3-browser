Yeah, that doesn't sound good to me either. Yet, I loath trying to find a file in S3 through the AWS web console or CLI. Why _isn't_ there a trustworthy OSS option?

Well thanks to Claude, now there is.  The first pass of this took roughly 2 or 3 distracted hours telling my buddy Claudius what I wanted and what to change. And it friggin works! 🎉

## Disclaimers

1. I do not plan to provide binary builds. That defeats the principle of not putting your most sensitive keys into software you can't introspect. If you can't build this on your own, maybe you shouldn't be using software?
2.  Use this at your own risk. I do.
3. Since this was kind of lark, I don't have a roadmap but you can certainly raise an issue, fork, or PR if you find a bug, want to totally steal my AI generated code, or add and improvement.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- AWS credentials configured in `~/.aws/credentials`
- AWS config (optional) in `~/.aws/config` for default regions

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Development

Run the application in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start Vite dev server and launch Electron with hot-reload enabled.

## Building

```bash
npm run build
```

Build outputs will be in the `release/` directory.

### Platform-Specific Builds

The build system uses electron-builder and supports:

## Usage

### Basic Navigation

1. **Select Profile**: Choose an AWS profile from the dropdown
2. **Select Region**: Choose an AWS region (defaults to profile's configured region)
3. **Browse Buckets**: Click on a bucket in the left sidebar to view its contents
4. **Filter Buckets**: Use the search box to filter buckets by name
5. **Navigate Folders**: Click on folders to drill down, use breadcrumbs to navigate up
6. **Filter Files**: Use the search box to filter files and folders in real-time

### File Operations

- **Download**: Click the download icon next to any file to save it locally
- **Preview**: Click the preview icon to download and open files with your default application
- **Upload**: Click the "Upload" button or drag-and-drop files into the file list
- **Copy Path**: Click the copy icon to copy the S3 URI (s3://bucket/key) to clipboard
- **Delete**: Click the delete icon to remove files or folders (with confirmation)

### Folder Operations

- **Create Folder**: Click the "New Folder" button to create a new folder/prefix
- **Delete Folder**: Click the delete icon on any folder to recursively delete all contents

## Security

- AWS credentials remain in the Electron main process and are never exposed to the renderer
- Uses Electron's `contextBridge` for secure IPC communication
- All S3 operations are validated before execution

## License

MIT

## Development Notes

- The application uses AWS SDK v3 with credential providers
- Profile parsing supports both `[profile name]` and `[default]` syntax
- S3 prefixes are treated as folders using the delimiter `/`
- Folders are created by uploading empty objects with trailing `/`
- Folder deletion recursively deletes all objects with that prefix
- Drag-and-drop uses Electron's `webUtils.getPathForFile()` API
- File type icons are provided by Iconify with VSCode Icons collection
- File transfers show error messages for failed operations
- All operations include confirmation dialogs and user feedback
